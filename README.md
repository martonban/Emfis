# Emfis
 
![Cover](cover.png)
<br><br>
Emfis was a productivity application wich I developed in 2018-2019. This application is developed in Visual Basic and WinForms. The source code was lost over the years. But as a high schooler my code was not the best quality, so probably it's better for me I lost it :D <br>
With this application you can block sites for a time interval. On this period of time the chosen sites are not going to loaded regardless of your browser. Note: This project is a ""startup"" for Hungarian students. So everything in the software and the website will be in Hungarian.

This is the block function. You can add custom links to your list. After you picked all the sites (from your own list or the pre-added) afther that you want to block you can set up the requermented time period. Push the start button and these sites will be unavailable unitl the timer expires. <br><br>
