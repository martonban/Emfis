# Emfis
Emfis was a productivity application wich I developed in 2018-2019. This application is developed in Visual Basic and WinForms. The source code was lost over the years plus it was developed by high schooler, so probably it's better I lost it :D <br>
With this application you can block sites for a time interval. On this time period of time the chosen sites is not going to loaded regardless of your browser. Note: This project is a ""startup"" for Hungarian students.
