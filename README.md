# Emfis

<br><br>
Emfis was a productivity application wich I developed in 2018-2019. This application is developed in Visual Basic and WinForms. The source code was lost over the years plus it was developed by high schooler, so probably it's better I lost it :D <br>
With this application you can block sites for a time interval. On this time period of time the chosen sites is not going to loaded regardless of your browser. Note: This project is a ""startup"" for Hungarian students.

This is the block function. You can add custom links to your list. After you picked all the sites, from your own list or the pre-added you can set a timer. Push the start button and these sites will be unavailable during the timer. <br><br>

I developed a tutorial inside the software. If you never used this software before a pop-up message will offer a walkthrough. This tutorial helped you to add links, set a timer etc.
